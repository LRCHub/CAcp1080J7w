```
I'm waiting for
A train that never comes
The station floor
Is lined with scattered pictures
Of places
I thought that I would go
The way forward
Through pain that's left me numb
Is still unsure
The compass was a promise
To shine here
To make it on your own
So you keep on waiting
Wanting
Faking you're someone you're not
Reaching
Longing
Changing for someone
'Til you realize you're still just stuck here
Waiting for
A train that never comes
Back at the start, you bet a lot on hope
When there's a million different branching roads
Every decision, every line you wrote
There was a vision with each chord and every
note
Blank refrains came to life in darkness
Crowded cities, crisis and catharsis
So don't leave it alone
No don't leave me alone
You can say you miss home, back where your heart
is
A voice rings out
Cutting the noise
And maybe it's hopeless
Change without choice
Disaster and wonder, laughter through tears
The hourglass turns
We'll blink and the years have gone by
In a lifetime
Where nothing's set in stone
So you keep on waiting
Wanting
Faking you're someone you're not
Reaching
Longing
Changing for someone
'Til you realize you're still just stuck here
Waiting for
A chance to make it real
Everything you've wanted
Was right before your eyes
And in time, you'll find them again
Impossible dreams
For a moment in this fleeting life
You'll stand in the light of
All that you could be
I waited for
A train that's come and gone
For something more
I guess I'm walking home now
But you'll find me, no matter where I go
